## Heimdall vs Heimdall-Lite

There two versions of the MITRE Heimdall Viewer - the full [Heimdall](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall/) and the [Heimdall-Lite](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall-lite/) version. We produced each to meet different needs and use-cases.

## Installation from packager.io

curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/heimdall.repo https://dl.packager.io/srv/mitre/heimdall/master/installer/el/7.repo

yum install -y heimdall

systemctl start mongod
systemctl enable mongod

heimdall scale web=1

## Installation instructions for offline installation

1. On a machine which can access yum repository, add repo by running curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/heimdall.repo https://dl.packager.io/srv/mitre/heimdall/master/installer/el/7.repo
2. Run yum install --downloadonly heimdall ImageMagick-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc make automake mongodb-org-server ImageMagick, this will download the RPM packages required for hiemdall
3. Move the RPM packages to the box you are looking to install
4. On the box you moved the RPM packages to, navigate to that directory and run yum install `<name of packages>`
5. Run systemctl start mongod and systemctl enable mongod, then run heimdall scale web=1

### Dependencies

You can setup a deployment/development environment through bundler or docker.

If you wish to use docker, then the dependencies are:

- Docker
- docker-compose (installable with pip)

If you wish to use ruby and are on Ubuntu 16, then the dependencies are:

- Ruby 2.4.4
- build-essentials (your distribution's gcc package)
- Bundler
- libpq-dev
- nodejs
- mongodb

#### Run directly with Ruby (Instead of Docker)

This mode is primarily for developers, shared heimdall instances should be
deployed in production mode. Since this is a Ruby application it is suggested to use
Rbenv or RVM for ruby version management.

1. Install rbenv or RVM
1. Install dependencies
   - `apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev nodejs libxml2-dev libmagick++-dev mongodb-server -y`
1. Install ruby by running `rbenv install` or `rvm install $(cat .ruby-version)` from the root directory of this project
1. Run the following in a terminal
   - `bundle install`
   - `bundle exec rake db:create`
   - `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
   - `bundle exec rails s` (Start the server on localhost)

#### Run With Docker

##### Login Configuration

If you would like to use your organization's internal User authentication
service, when deploying the dockerized Heimdall instance, you'll need to edit
config/ldap.yml to point to your organization's LDAP server. **You do not have
to use your internal LDAP. However, people will have to create an account in
Heimdall to perform most actions** You may view ldap.example.yml for how
authentication of people's internal email addresses works with a LDAP server
which allows anonymous access.

##### Setup Docker Container

These steps need to be performed once per machine in order to prepare your machine to run heimdall in Docker.

1. Install Docker
2. Download heimdall by running `git clone https://github.com/mitre/heimdall.git`.
3. Navigate to the base folder where `docker-compose.yml` is located
4. Run the following commands in a terminal window from the heimdall source directory:
   - `./setup-docker-secrets.sh`
   - `docker-compose up -d`

##### Managing Docker Container

The following commands are useful for managing the data in your docker container:
_ `docker-compose run web rake db:reset` **This destroys and rebuilds the db**
_ `docker-compose run web rake db:migrate` **This updates the db**

##### Running Docker Container

Make sure you have run the setup steps at least once before following these steps!

1. Run the following command in a terminal window:
   - `docker-compose up -d`
2. Go to `127.0.0.1:3000/heimdall` in a web browser

##### Updating Docker Container

A new version of the docker container can be retrieved by running

    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose run web bundle exec rake db:migrate

This will fetch the latest version of the container, redeploy if a newer version exists, and then apply any database migrations if applicable. No data should be lost by this operation.

###### Stopping the Container

`docker-compose down` # From the source directory you started from

## Usage

You can access a Demo instance if you have access to the company's intranet at
https://inspec-dev.mitre.org

You can login via the company LDAP server, or by creating a new account.

Once you have an account you can upload jsons for evaluations and profiles
then view them by clicking on the evaluations and profiles tab at the top of
the page.

**When uploading data you may go to the circles tab, and select public. This will
allow all visitors to view the profile/evaluation you uploaded.**

To upload through curl you'll need an API key. This is located on your profile
page which can be reached by clicking on your user name in the top right
corner, then on profile.

The upload API takes three parameters: the file, your email address, and your API key.

```
curl -F "file=@FILE_PATH" -F email=EMAIL -F api_key=API_KEY http://localhost:3000/evaluation_upload_api
```

## Configuration

See docker-compose.yml for container configuration

#### Build container from behind an Intercepting proxy

Contact us for advice, we'll be able to send most people our setup.

#### Host container off relative url

Edit RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT line from docker-compose.yml

#### Switch container to dev mode

Set RAILS_ENV = to development in docker-compose.yml
